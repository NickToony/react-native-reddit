# /r/aww feed in React Native + Typescript
A quick Android + iOS app created to trial the responsiveness of React Native. The goal is to deliver a feed of images from a subreddit with performance as close to Native as possible.

## Installing and Running
You can use `yarn` or `npm install` to get everything set up, and then use `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`. Don't forget to set up your React Native tools first.

## Next Steps
Aside from minor improvements to UI animations and transitions, the plan is to develop equivalent apps in NativeScript and Flutter to compare to the workflow, performance and viability of each stack in production.
